# Terraform-AWS-Slack
Terraform repo to create an SNS topic and a Lambda function that sends notifications to a Slack channel.
I created this small project to better my understanding related to connecting my Terraform Cloud workspace to a Version Control System (GitHub). When a commit is made to this repo, a Terraform run executes within the Terraform Cloud to make underlying changes to my AWS account's infrastructure.
